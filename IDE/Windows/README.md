# wolfboot for Windows

A variety of Windows-based solutions exist. Here are notes for a no-IDE build on Windows from a DOS prompt.

- [Visual Studio](../VisualStudio/README.md)

# Example

See the [WOLFBOOT_ROOT/tools/scripts/cmake_test.bat](../../tools/scripts/cmake_test.bat) using cmake:

```dos
rmdir /s /q build-stm32l4

cmake --preset stm32l4
cmake --build --preset stm32l4
```

## Troubleshooting

This error is typically caused by anti-virus software locking a file during build.

Consider excluding the build directory or executable from anti-virus scan.

```test
build-stm32l4\bin-assemble.exe - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.
```
