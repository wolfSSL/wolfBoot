# Using One-Time Programmable (OTP) flash area for keystore

Some microcontrollers provide a special area in flash memory that can
only be written once and cannot be erased.

This feature comes particularly handy when you want to store the public keys required
to authenticate the firmware update images, which has exactly the same requirements. A public
key is a cryptographic key that can be freely distributed and is used to verify the signature
of the firmware update image. By storing the public keys in the OTP area, you can ensure that
they are immutable and cannot be tampered with.

## Compiling wolfBoot to access OTP as keystore

To use the OTP area as a keystore, you need to compile wolfBoot with the `FLASH_OTP_KEYSTORE`
option enabled. This option is disabled by default, which means that the keystore is incorporated into
the wolfBoot binary itself.

When wolfBoot uses the OTP area as a keystore, it reads the public keys from the OTP area at runtime.
The public keys are stored in the OTP area, after an initial 16-byte header that contains the number of
keys stored, the size of each key, and other information.

In order for wolfBoot to start authenticating the firmware images at boot and upon update, the public keys
must be provisioned to the OTP area in a separate step, as described in the next sections.

Depending on the target device, you can either prepare a binary image of the OTP area content, or use `otp-keystore-primer` firmware to directly provision the keys on the target.

## Creating an image of the OTP area content

It is possible to create a binary image of the content for the OTP area. The resulting file (otp.bin) can be manually provisioned using any external tool that allows writing to the target OTP area.

To compile the otp-keystore-gen tool using the current keystore content:

```sh
make otpgen
```

And then, to create the image file `otp.bin`:


```sh
./tools/keytools/otp/otp-keystore-gen
```


## Directly provisioning the public keys to the OTP area (primer)

After enabling the `FLASH_OTP_KEYSTORE` option in your `.config` file, when you compile wolfBoot by running "make",
an additional application called `otp-keystore-primer` is generated under `tools/keytools/otp`. This application is used to
provision the public keys to the OTP area. By flashing this application to the microcontroller, the public keys contained
in your keystore (previously generated by `keygen`) are written to the OTP area.

The `otp-keystore-primer` application is generated with the public keys embedded in it. The keys are retrieved from the `keystore.c` file,
generated by the `keygen` command. The `otp-keystore-primer` application reads the public keys from the `keystore.c` file and writes them to the OTP area.

After generating a new `keystore.c` with the `keygen` application, you can generate the `otp-keystore-primer` application again, by running `make otp`.

> [!WARNING]
> The `otp-keystore-primer` application is a one-time use application. Once the application runs on your target, the public keys are written to the OTP area,
> and it will be impossible to erase them. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the public keys are correct before provisioning them to the OTP area,
> and that the associated private keys are stored securely. Accidentally losing the private keys will render the public keys stored in the OTP area useless.

> [!CAUTION]
> ** Be very careful when using the `otp-keystore-primer` application. Use it at your own risk. **


## Examples

### STM32H5 OTP KeyStore

Example for NULCLEO-STM32H563ZI with TrustZone (via PKCS11), DualBank and signing with PQ LMS:

1) Setup the configuration and key tools:

```sh
cp config/examples/stm32h5-tz-dualbank-otp-lms.config .config
make include/target.h
make keytools
```

2) Generate key(s) to write to OTP

  - `./examples/keytools/keygen --lms -g 1.key -g 2.key -g 3.key -g 4.key -g 5.key`

3) Backup the generated keys and `src/keystore.c`
  - Save to safe place outside of the wolfBoot tree

4) Set the signing key to use

  - Copy one of the generated keys to `wolfboot_signing_private_key.der`
  - `cp 1.key wolfboot_signing_private_key.der`

5) Setup the option bytes
  - User Configuration 2 -> TrustZone Enable (TZEN=0xB4)
  - Bank1 - Flash Watermark area (SECWM1_START=0x00, SECWM1_END=0x1F)
  - Bank2 - Flash Watermark area (SECWM2_START=0x00, SECWM2_END=0x1F)

6) Build wolfBoot and test application using `make`

7) Flash the OTP keystore primer:

  - Flash `./tools/keytools/otp/otp-keystore-primer.bin` to `0x08000000`

8) Disconnect the tool and reboot
  - The primer will run and flash keystore.c to OTP.
  - Verify you flashed the keystore in OTP
  - Read memory from STM32CubeProgrammer at address `0x08FFF000` (should start with ASCII "WOLFBOOT")

9) Mass erase the device
  - STM32CubeProgrammer -> Full chip erase

10) Flash wolfBoot and test-app

 - Flash `wolfboot.bin` at `0x0C000000`
 - Flash `test-app/image_v1_signed.bin` at `0x08040000`

11) Disconnect and reboot, the red LED should turn on.

12) Connect to USB UART on NUCLEO board for console

13) Test Update

  - Sign a new version of the firmware: `./tools/keytools/sign --lms test-app/image.bin wolfboot_signing_private_key.der 2`
  - Run "update" command on the shell and wait for xmodem transfer
  - Use serial terminal that supports xmodem like "minicom" or "CoolTerm".
    * Run `minicom` on `/dev/ttyACM0` and start file transfer using "CTRL+A; S"
    * Select xmodem then navigate to the new signed firmware file `test-app/image_v2_signed.bin`
  - During the transfer, the yellow LED will flash.
  - The green LED is dim because it's sync with the UART RX
  - At the end of the transfer, the new image will be in the update partition.
  - Reset board to install new firmware and confirm new version number.

Example update output:

```sh
