## wolfCrypt in TrustZone-M secure domain

ARMv8-M microcontrollers support hardware-assisted domain separation for running
software. This TEE mechanism provides two separate domains (secure & non-secure),
and an additional zone that can be used as interface to call into secure
functions from the non-secure domain (non-secure callable).

wolfBoot may optionally export the crypto functions as a non-callable APIs that
are accessible from any software staged in non-secure domain.

### Compiling wolfBoot with wolfCrypt in TrustZone-M secure domain

When wolfBoot is compiled with the options `TZEN=1` and `WOLFCRYPT_TZ=1`,
a more complete set of components of the wolfCrypt crypto library are built-in
the bootloader, and they can be accessed by applications or OSs running in
non-secure domain through non-secure callable APIs.

This feature is used to isolate the core crypto operations from the applications.

### PKCS11 API in non-secure world

The `WOLFCRYPT_TZ_PKCS11` option provides a standard PKCS11 interface,
including a storage for PKCS11 objects in a dedicated flash area in secure mode.

This means that applications, TLS libraries and operating systems running in
non-secure domain can access wolfCrypt through a standard PKCS11 interface and
use the crypto library with pre-provisioned keys that are never exposed to the
non-secure domain.

### Image header size

The `IMAGE_HEADER_SIZE` option has to be carefully tuned to accommodate for the
interrupt vector table alignment requirements. According to the [ARM Cortex-M33
documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100235/0004/the-cortex-m33-processor/exception-model/vector-table):

> The silicon vendor must configure the required alignment of the vector
> tables, which depends on the number of interrupts implemented. The minimum
> alignment is 32 words, enough for up to 16 interrupts. For more interrupts,
> adjust the alignment by rounding up to the next power of two. For example, if
> you require 21 interrupts, the alignment must be on a 64-word boundary
> because the required table size is 37 words, and the next power of two is 64.

For example, all the STM32H5 series boards have at least 146 interrupt
channels; since the next power of two is 256, they require an alignment of 1024
bytes (256Ã—4). As a result, in this case `IMAGE_HEADER_SIZE` must be set to
`1024` or a multiple of it.

This detail is already taken care of in the configuration files provided in
`config/examples`.

In addition to this, when using the signing tool standalone the appropriate
image header size must be supplied as an environment variable. For example:

```
IMAGE_HEADER_SIZE=1024 ./tools/keytools/sign --sha256 --ecc256 myapp.bin wolfboot_signing_private_key.der 1
```

### Example using STM32L552

  - Copy the example configuration for STM32-L5 with support for wolfCrypt in
    TrustZone-M and PKCS11 interface: `cp config/examples/stm32l5-wolfcrypt-tz.config .config`

  - Run `make`. `wolfboot.elf` and the test applications are built as separate
    objects. The application is signed and stored as `test-app/image_v1_signed.bin`.

  - Ensure that the option bytes on your target device are set as follows:
